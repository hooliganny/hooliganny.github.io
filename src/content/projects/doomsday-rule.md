## What

The Doomsday Rule is a rule that one can use to calculate the day of any date in the modern calendar in their head. I thought that this would be a pretty cool party trick to learn as well as a good experience for me to teach others. The content of this site will be based on my good friend Stefan's description found [here](https://histefanhere.com/doomsday-algorithm/).

## How

This was made in React to broaden my horizons (as previously I had only worked in Vue) and is a [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/hooliganny/doomsday-rule-practise).

## Why

While I was searching for a job, I was looking for a way of improving my skills, and learning more technologies that I can use to apply my skills in the workplace. I also wanted to work on something that few people knew about, and that fewer people had done before. I was able to find a few online calculators, but I wanted my work to be more of a learning tool, so that someone who doesn't know the rule can learn from nothing, but also that someone who does know can test themself.
