## My first solo site!

My first solo project was a portfolio site/blog, where I intended to post any significant updates to my career. This site was made in Hugo, a Go-based static HTML site generator. Each post had corresponding tags that could categorise the posts, and would link to the respective projects (if applicable). Through it, I learnt about static site generation and the simplest parts of GitHub Actions and website deployment/hosting.

However, because I was (and still am) continuously self-conscious about my design skills, I chose to use a pre-made template so I could get into the DevOps aspects, which, at the time, I thought would be more interesting. The theme used was [Paper 6](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) (much better than I could ever create at the time), but had some flaws and tweaks needed to make it my own - such as the unnecessary tags system. I found the DX of Hugo nice, a little under-documented - but looking back at it, I don't think it was the right tool for the job long-term. It did as advertised, built fast with zero JavaScript, and it was nice to get a foot in the door with general HTML templates. However, as I was at the start of my career, it would've been more useful to play with JavaScript (as I have in this iteration of the site) - as that is what is required in today's market, i.e. React/Angular/Vue.

As such, I decided a bit later that I would remake my portfolio site from scratch with a different technology stack - the version you are seeing now! You can read more about this site [here](/about).
