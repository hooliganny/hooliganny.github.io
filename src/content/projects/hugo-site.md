## The site

My first solo project was a home-made blog, where I posted any significant updates to my portfolio. Each post had corresponding tags, and links to the respective projects (if applicable). It was constructed as a place where I could both see my growth, showcase it to others, and improve my web dev skills along the way. Through it, I leart about static site generation and the simplest parts of GitHub actions and hosting.

This site was made in Hugo, a Go based static site generator. While I know the basics of Hugo from many YouTube tutorials, I decided against trying to reinvent the wheel and instead just used a premade theme. The theme used was [Paper 6](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) (much better than I could ever create), but had some flaws and tweaks needed to make it my own.
