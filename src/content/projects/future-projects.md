Currently, I have a few projects planned. Once they are started, they will go here. Once they are complete, they will get their own page.

## Current projects

### This site

I currently am in the process of working on this Astro port of my website previous website. For my previous site, I had worked with the Hugo static site generator, but I have since found it too foreign with the tools that I currently work with at my job (cough, cough, Javascript), and so I decided to do a re-write. I believe it will be more maintainable this way, as well as hopefully making development easier. The styles (as always) still need work...

### Unnamed Svelte+Electron

As I was growing up, my dream job was a game developer, and I think one way to get there is through Software Development. As I am currently a web developer, this will require some effort, and so working with Electron seems like a good time to see if I have what it takes to develop software (even if Electron is a little cheating).

I also have passion for web development however, and Svelte has always been on my radar as a good replacement to React (which I am not particularly fond of). Since Electron seems to be mostly web development translated to a desktop app, this could be a good time to kill two birds with one stone.

I don't know what I will work on yet, but I have a few ideas, such as a interactive game client, possibly a fan rewrite of the League Client (non-functional, of course).

## Tools I want to work with more/pick up

### Next.js 13+

### SvelteKit

### Vue/Nuxt 3

### Anything backend
