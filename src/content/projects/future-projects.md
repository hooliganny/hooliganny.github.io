Currently, I have a few projects planned. Once they are started, they will go here. Once they are complete, they will get their own post.

## Current projects

### This site

I currently am in the process of working on this Astro port of my website previous website. For my previous site, I had worked with the Hugo static site generator, but I have since found it too foreign with the tools that I currently work with at my job (cough, cough, Javascript), and so I decided to do a re-write. I believe it will be more maintainable this way, as well as hopefully making development easier. The styles (as always) still need work...

### Construction Company Website

I'm developing a website for a family member's construction business. It's a straightforward project focused on clear and to-the-point copy. For now, I'm using the Next.js App Router to statically generate the site into HTML - which will help with loading speeds. As their business grows and requirements evolve, I can easily switch to server-side rendering (SSR) with Server Components.

### Unnamed Svelte+Electron

As I was growing up, my dream job was a Game Developer, and I think one way to get there is through Software Development. Working with Electron seems like it could be a good way to bridge my knowledge of Web Development into Software/App Development, and from there perhaps more career opportunities can open (even if Electron is a little cheating).

I still have a passion for Web Development however, and Svelte has always been on my radar as a good replacement to React (React, in my experience, provides too many foot-guns, something compiled like Svelte or Vue seems better in that aspect). With the release of Svelte 5 and Runes, it could be a good place to start.

I don't know what I will work on yet, but I have a few ideas, such as a interactive mock-game client.

## Tools I want to work with in the future

### Next.js App Router - Server Components (once it's production-ready)

### SvelteKit

### Vue/Nuxt 3

### Anything backend
