## About me

My name is Sam and I'm a Full Stack Developer. I enjoy learning about the ways the web works and learning all the different ways of approaching the everyday problems we find ourselves in.

For work/programming related things, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-white-212330261/), [GitHub](https://github.com/hooliganny), and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/hooliganny/).

To see what I am currently watching/playing, or to see if you have better taste, you can find me on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur171392741) and [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/hooliganny/games/).

## About this site

This is my portfolio site, which I am treating as a mini-blog of sorts. Here I will post any significant updates to my portfolio or resume, or things that I think are just interesting enough to share.

This site is made in Astro, and is primarily an excuse to play around with the new View Transitions API and some other frontend frameworks.

My hope is that this site will act as a place where I can both see my growth, as well as showcase it to others.
