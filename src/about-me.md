## About this site

Welcome to my mini-blog, here I will post any significant updates to my portfolio. Each post will have corresponding tags, and links to the right places (if applicable).

My hope is that this site will act as a place where I can both see my growth, as well as showcase it to others.

## About me

Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-white-212330261/), and if you wanna connect, here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/hooliganny) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/hooliganny/).

Because I have nowhere else at the moment to put this, here is my GitHub commit history. This includes my private repos such as [Project Matched]({{< ref "project-matched" >}}) and [SafeFood4U]({{< ref "safefood4u-website" >}}).
